                        Computer Sciences, University Sains Malaysia. She has 35 years of professional career
                        with both breadth and depth in several areas of expertise and has made significant
                        contributions in these areas. With ever new exciting areas emerging, for example Data
                        Science, Deep learning, IoT etc., the key for success and sustainability, she is excited
                        to be part of the Data Science group at Asia Pacific University who has pioneered in
                        establishing Data Science academic programs. <br>
                        Currently Mandava’s passion is in Data science with an intention to
                        research and
                        extend machine learning and deep learning techniques to multimodal domains of

                        medical imaging, artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, data mining
                        through several research projects. While my major domain has been image related, her
                        focus is on the core methods that are applicable to many other domains. These core
                        methods are: Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence, Datamining, Optimization
                        and Meta-heuristics. Some of the specific areas are clustering, classification, fuzzy and
                        rough sets, nature inspired metaheuristics, random walks, variational methods, graph
                        cuts etc.

                        These include machine vision in in late 80s, robot vision in early 90s, medical image
                        research, computer aided diagnosis solutions and medical image related IT products
                        through 2010. In 2015, started with Neuroimaging with specific focus on Diffusion
                        based imaging with a primary objective to extract, visualise and examine brain white
                        matter fiber tracts to assist in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and
                        assist neuro surgery.
